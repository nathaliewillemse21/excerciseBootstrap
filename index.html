 [Verse 1: Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin]
 Now it has grown to be so clear
 The unfamiliar shadow amidst those cheers
  Perhaps I wouldn't be able to believe words:
 "Let's see and hear only good things" no more
 Your silent sadness, it shakes me
 In my quiet sea, waves would sometimes rise</p>
 

 <p class="lead text-bg-white">Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
 Louder than bombs, I break (Ah)
 All the pain pour out (Ah)
 From the moment I knew
 The expression you had on wasn't that expression
 Louder than bombs, I break (Oh, oh, oh)</p>


 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Verse 2: RM]
Baby, I'm nothin'er than nothin'
Brighter than the light
Don't you want a thing from me
But you say I'm somethin'er than somethin'
Brighter than the light
Don't you give up your life
Here I stay, pray
Just for better days
Everyday a maze
 Wonder if this is my place</p>



 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Verse 3: j-hope]
Where's my way?
The ground keeps quaking
I collapse on my own, mute
Louder than bombs, yeah
I want to tell you, that darkness
Exists everywhere, don't be afraid of it
Whatever night may swallow me, I won't give up
 The fight for you, we'll shine</p>


 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
You and I, we feel it together
Sadness and pain
It's not a coincidence
 Yeah, we picked this game</p>

 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook, V, Jimin]
Louder than bombs, I say (Ah)
I'll tell it in front of the world (Ah)
The times I've ignored you
The days where I kept running away, there won't be any more
 Louder than bombs, I say (Oh, oh, oh)</p>


 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Verse 4: Suga]
People say they're jealous of us
The pain I have, they say it's hypocrisy
No matter what I do, I get caught up in shit
If not us, yeah, who will do it?
People say they're jealous of us
The pain I have, they say it's hypocrisy
No matter what I do, I get caught up in shit
 If not us, yeah, who will do it?</p>

 <p class="lead text-bg-white">[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]
Louder than bombs, I sing (Oh, oh, oh)
Make a promise for you and I (Oh, oh, oh)
Whatever wave may sweep over us
We will endlessly sing to you
 Louder than bombs, I sing (Oh, oh, oh, oh)</p></div>></div>
